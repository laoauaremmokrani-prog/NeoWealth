# NeoWealth AI Stock Market Prediction System

## Overview

NeoWealth predicts S&P 500 direction, sectors, and top companies using a hybrid AI model combining:

- **MLP:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for numeric data (macroeconomics, market data)
- **AI:** OpenAI LLM for geopolitical and investor sentiment analysis

The system works in three tiers:

- **Tier 1:** Data scraping and ingestion (macroeconomics, geopolitics, sentiment)
- **Tier 2:** Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering
- **Tier 3:** Prediction tier integrating MLP and LLM for hybrid forecasting

Frontend is React-based, sleek, and uses mock data for demos. Backend integration is optional.
